# 👋 Hello, I'm Niraj Malindu

I'm a passionate *Full-Stack Developer* and *Creative Designer* from 🇱🇰 Sri Lanka, with a strong drive to build meaningful digital experiences. With over 3 years of experience, I specialize in building dynamic Laravel-based web applications and crafting clean, modern user interfaces.

I love solving real-world problems through technology — whether it's developing a full-featured dashboard or designing intuitive UX with tools like Photoshop and Figma.
